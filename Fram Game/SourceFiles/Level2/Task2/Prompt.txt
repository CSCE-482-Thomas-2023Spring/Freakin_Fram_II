Name and feed the frogs!

We are conducting a study on frogs.
We need to feed the frogs,
but first we need to name these frogs
The name of frog_1 is Fred.
The name of frog_2 is Ash.
The name of fog_3 is Kyle.

Now we need to feed the frogs.
This is similar to filling the beakers.
But now, we will be working with integers rather than floats.
Give Fred 4 pieces of food.
Give Ash 12 pieces of food.
Give Kyle 2 pieces of food.
