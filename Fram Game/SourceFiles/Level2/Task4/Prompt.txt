Calculate the year!

We found a bacteria in space. Initially, the bacteria is 10 cm^2.
We have been studying it and have figured out that it doubles every 0.9 hours.
Calculate when it will be at least 200 cm^2 and set year_of_200 to that value.

Hint: There should be no decimals in the year
Hint: log(x, b) returns log_b(x)
