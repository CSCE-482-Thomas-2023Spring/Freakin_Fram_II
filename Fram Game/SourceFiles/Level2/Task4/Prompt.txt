Calculate the year!

We found a bacteria in space. Initially, the bacteria is 10 cm^2.
We have been studying it and have figured out that it doubles every 0.9 hours.
Calculate the size of the bacteria after 3.6 hours.

Hint: You can multiply a variable by a value and then assign the result to the same variable (see starter code)
