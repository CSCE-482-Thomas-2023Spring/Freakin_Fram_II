Correct the collision avoidance system!

During the system damage, the collison avoidance settings of the ship was changed

Fix the settings based off these instructions:

If an asteroid is 200m away or farther, just log it in the ship's log with "log_asteroid()".

If an asteroid is between 100m away and 200m away, double-check the distance with "ping_asteroid()" and log it with "log_asteroid()".

If an asteroid is closer than 100m and 5m across or larger, blast it with "blast_it()"!

If an asteroid is closer than 100m and is less than 5m across, avoid it with "take_evasive_move(size_of_asteroid)" and then get the ship back on track with "course_correct()".
